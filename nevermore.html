               Hello, my name is Josué Filipe, I am currently 20 years old, I work at Nova Software company as technical support, and I dream of being a good front-end developer in the future. As I am without anything else to do at the moment, I decided to create a personal page, to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS.My favorite hobby is playing, in fact, it's always been that since I was a child. It's difficult to choose a favorite game of my life, but I have some very special ones. On this page, I'll try to talk a little bit about them, amount of content possible. I will try to talk a little about movies and series that I like. My idea, and fill the page of things about my life, but so far only thought of these two, we will see more forward what will arise in my mind.

               <h3>First Job</h3>
               At the end of 2017, my friend Bruno called me one morning, asking me to work at his vehicle license shop, because his uncle, who was the manager of the place and was there with Bruno, had died. I accepted the offer, both for the friendship, and for the experience and money that would be paid. It was a temporary job, but it was worth it, because it was an experience.

               <h3>Nova Software</h3>
                After spending the entire 2018 year looking for a job, and to no avail, I was about to leave it aside for a while, when suddenly one of my interviews went well, and I was called to work at Nova Software. I started on December 3, 2018, and I am still in the company today. Nova Software is a company that has developed a traceability system for another company, CBM Placas, of the new vehicle license plates. For a large part of the clients, being computer lay people, many have doubts and difficulties to use the system, so Nova Software hired a group of people to provide support for these clients, and that's where I came in.

               <h3>Sistema Nova</h3>
                When I did my interview for Nova Software, I talked a little about my knowledge in HTML and CSS, and how much I liked it. In the future, my coordinator said that one of the reasons for my hiring was precisely this one. After a few months of working at the company, she came to me and my colleague Douglas, and asked us to develop a system for the company. A system that had the entire spreadsheet of clients, would be able to create calling tickets, and control emails. At first we discussed whether this was a viable thing, considering that our knowledge was not great in this area. We bought a C# course to try to learn how to create the system in this language, but it was not doing well. One day, we decided to change and make PHP. Douglas and Lucas, who eventually joined the project later, kind of abandoned it, but I did, and I created the whole front end, after that, I learned and applied the database and PHP. Currently the system is ready, and beginning its testing phase.
